      <h1 class="rules">The Official Rule Book:</h1>

      <p class="rules">
          King of the Hill or Sandwich or Trump was originally created for 2-3-4-5 player games,
          but it can be played with really as many players as you like. Also, the original name
          of the game was Trump (before he got elected) because the Ace is an overpowering trump
          card that automatically wins you the hand if played in a sequence or derby (and can't
          be battled except if in a battle already).
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-Object of the game:</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          Win the most amount of cards or get to the objective set amount of cards first (say you
          play first to win 50 cards). Win cards by winning play piles. Number of cards in the pile
          won = the number of cards added to your score.
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-Set up:</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          Each player starts off with your choice of hand size, 10 or 12 cards is normal. You also
          need to set a refuel number so that, after a round, players with the refuel amount of cards
          remaining in their hand can grab more from the deck until they have the hand-size number.
          A standard refuel number is half the hand size plus a card or two, so starting with 12 cards
          I would use 7 as a refuel number (for say 15 I'd do 8 or 9).
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-Directions:</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          To start the game everybody participates in a {Battle} (in the app though, the person who
          creates the room starts the game). After, follow {Order of Play} and {normal play} begins.
          Higher cards are better to start the game. When playing with a 12 card starting hand and
          after a round you find yourself with 7 cards or less, you {Refuel}. {Refueling} only takes
          place after the round is over/before the next round. Winner of the previous round plays
          first/starts the next round. Play always goes clockwise, and always continues clockwise from
          whoever played last. The winner is the last person still in who hasn't {Folded} or been knocked
          out by a {Sandwich}. If so he/she wins the round, he/she adds the total amount of cards from the
          pile to their score. The winner then plays first in the next hand. Winner of the game is first
          to reach a decided score tally or have the highest score once the deck runs out and there arenâ€™t
          two players who can play anymore. When/if there is one person left with cards in their hand at the
          end of the game, he/she does not add those cards to his/her score. To start a round a single card
          must be played. You CANT start a round by playing more than 1 card: a {Derby}.
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-Refuel:</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          If the game started with 12 cards per person then once you have the refuel number of cards in your
          hand, take turns picking cards from the deck until everyone who needed to {refuel} has the starting
          amount.
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-Normal Play: 1 card play where {folding} is present</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          The normal sequence of play is to go clockwise from the winner of the last round.
          Each player has to play a better card then the last person. When it is your turn you
          have exactly 4 options:
      </p>
      <ul class="rules">
          <li>#1 you can play a better card then the previous card.</li>
          <li>
              #2 play a card of the same value: this means you initiate a {Battle} or a {Sandwich}
              if you play multiple cards of the same value of the last card played.
          </li>
          <li>#3 play a {9} as a {wild} card.</li>
          <li>#4 {Fold}</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="rules">-Folding:</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          If a player cannot beat, or does not want to play/beat the previous single card he must fold and
          is knocked out of the round. This is done by playing one or many cards from his hand face down on
          the deck (folding many cards can be strategic for refueling/building a better hand).
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-Battling:</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          If the card played is of the same value as the previous card it is a {Battle}. When a {Battle}
          occurs, both players choose one card and lay it face down before showing their card to their
          opponent. Best card wins depending on the game value. If the cards are of the same value, {Battle}
          again. If three people participate, but only two play cards that are of the same value and both are
          tied for the best, better than the third person's, the two players play in another battle while the
          third person gets knocked out. You can {Battle} someone even if it is not your turn (just play your
          card of the same value that was just played). More than 2 people can participate in a {Battle}. In a
          {Derby} If two or more people lay down doubles or triples or more of the same value then they battle
          using just one card as usual. In a {Derby} you can {Battle} someone out of turn.
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-Derby: no {folding}, just playing and {passing}</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          A Derby occurs when someone has 2, 3, 4 or more of the same valued card in their hand. Once a Derby
          is started there is no {Folding} order of play continues clockwise (there can be {battles}) and each
          player has two options: either play or say 'pass'. If you pass you are still in the round, you are
          just electing not to play, however, if people continue to pass and it gets back to the person who's
          cards are currently the last played/on top of the pile, then the Derby is over and he/she wins. You
          CANT use a {wild 9} in a {Derby} and you CANT start a round with a {Derby}. Any triples beats any
          doubles, any quadruples (4 of a kind) beats any triples or doubles and so on, but, in order to start
          a {Derby} the value of the cards you are playing must be better than the card previously played (no
          matter how many cards you play): if a five was played last and higher cards are better, one cannot
          play two 4s or three 2s, two or three 6s would work. {Aces} automatically win the {Derby} and pile
          if the same or more are played: 3 8s are played cant play 1 or 2 aces, need 3 (or more if you want).
      </p class="rules">

      <h3 class="rules">-The Nine:</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          If a 9 is played, it can act as a regular nine, or, it can be played as a wild card that changes the
          value of play: making lower cards better than higher cards or higher cards better than lower cards:
          always the opposite of what it was. (a wild 9 has to switch the order of value, you CANT have higher
          cards be better, play a wild 9, and say higher cards are still better). When a 9 is used as wild, it
          has no value and even though it acts as your turn, it is not the card the next person has to beat:
          the card played before the wild 9 was played becomes the card the current player must beat. Basically
          you can play them anytime, on any single card, except on an {Ace} or during a {derby}. You can also
          play them in a {Battle}, you will just never win but you will be able to switch the direction. If higher
          cards are better and, before anyone flips their cards you announce your card is a wild 9, you switch
          direction. This does influence the outcome of a {Battle} if more than 2 people participate in the {Battle}:
          if higher cards are better and you play a wild 9 and player #2 plays an 8 and player #3 plays a 10, player
          #2 wins because of the switch. The wild 9's value switch stays in effect for the rest of the game until the
          value is switched again by another wild 9 (continues across rounds). Wild 9s cannot be battled with another
          {wild 9} since they hold no value so if two people are {Battling} and the both play wild 9s (in real life
          this probably wouldn't happen since after the first person announced their 9 is wild the second would keep
          their 9 normal so they win the {Battle}) nobody wins, its a tie, and the direction is not switched since
          the wild 9s switching cancels out since 2 are played.
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-The Ace:</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          The ace beats any single card (regardless of higher or lower value, it beats a king in higher
          play and 2 in lower play) and automatically wins any pile on the spot when played. You CANT
          battle an ace when an it is played outside a {Battle}. Aces can only {Battle} when they are
          flipped up in a {Battle}. An {Ace} cannot beat doubles unless you have 2 aces, same with triples
          and so on. If multiple are played in a {Derby} then they automatically win the round on the spot.
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-The Joker:</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          Can take on any value 2 through king. Cannot become a {wild 9} or {Ace}. Can also be used as a
          rotten egg: if {Folded} (obviously, secretly), after the round ends reveal it and no one wins
          the card pile. You can play the rotten egg in a battle but you have to specify that its an egg
          before flipping.
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-Sandwiching: the most annoying and fun part of the game</h3>

      <p class="rules">There are two ways to {Sandwich} another player/multiple players:</p>
      <ul class="rules">
          <li>
              #1 your cards surround their card/s ex: you play a 7, next person {Battles}
              you with a 7, you play another 7, they are now sandwiched.
          </li>
          <li>
              #2 your cards (multiple) are played on top of their card/s (you have to have
              played more of a same valued card then the previous play ex: last person plays
              a 5 you sandwich her with 2 5's or last person plays 3 4's in a {Derby} and you
              sandwich him with 4 4's).
          </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="rules">
          A sandwich occurs when two or more of the same card surround another card of that same value,
          or are on top of a card of that same value. A sandwich does not occur if a different valued
          card takes place: you play a 7, next person plays an 8 and you playing another 7 is not
          possible/not a sandwich because your 7 is not the same value as the last played 8 so you
          cannot play out of turn/{Battle} that person: a sandwich is basically a modified {Battle}.
      </p>

      <h3 class="rules">-Un/re-sandwiching:</h3>

      <p class="rules">
          If you get/are sandwiched and you have another of that same card or a joker you can play it and you
          not only become un-sandwiched but you sandwich that other player: you play a 5, another person plays
          2 5's, you play a 5: that person is sandwiched because your 5s wrap around his even though you have
          both played the same number of 5s, you could even re-sandwich with 2 5's and start a {Derby}. If you
          fail to re-sandwich, you are knocked out. After a player/players are knocked out by getting sandwiched,
          play continues clockwise from the person who played last: this is the sandwicher. The next person then
          just has to beat the last card/cards played, not the entirety of what the sandwicher played if there
          were multiple plays between players during the sandwich episode. So, if you play a 5, another person
          plays 2 5's, you play a 5, the next person only has to beat a 5. If you play a 5, another person plays
          2 5's, you play 2 5's (still a sandwich) now its a {Derby} and the next person has to beat 2 5's.
      </p>

      <h1 class="rules">Gameplay examples:</h1>

      <h3 class="rules">Example #1, 3 person gameplay (no derby, battle, or sandwich):</h3>

      <ul class="rules">
          <li>
              Player #1 won the beginning {Battle} or started the online game: he played a queen, player #2 played
              a 10 and player #3 played a 6 so player #1 starts next round and wins 3 points since card pile consisted
              of 3 cards.
          </li>
          <li>Player #1 plays a 6 to start the round.</li>
          <li>
              Player #2 (clockwise from person 1) plays a 7 (if he wanted to {battle}, he would play a 6, and if
              player #3 wanted to jump in out-of-turn to {battle} player #1 he would have played a 6 before person
              2 played a card. If player #2 played a 6 player #3 could also join their {battle} if he plays a 6
              too => 3 person {battle}).
          </li>
          <li>Player #2 has played a 7.</li>
          <li>
              Player #3 although he could beat the 7 with a queen he has decides not to play and folds a card face down
              (he is out of the round).
          </li>
          <li>
              Back to player #1 who plays a {9 as a wild card}: this reverses the card value so lower cards are now
              better (turn 9 face down to represent it as a wild card and it does not have a value so next person to
              go has to play against player #2's Queen since it was the last play of value.
          </li>
          <li>
              Player #2 now has to beat himself since he played last valued card. He cannot play a 7 and {Battle}
              himself (not allowed), nor can he play multiple 7s so he plays a 2.
          </li>
          <li>
              Player #1 plays an {Ace} and wins the pile automatically, he now has a score of 6 for the number of
              cards in the pile he won(wild 9 and folded cards count), and he will start next round.
          </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="rules">Example #2, 3 person gameplay (derby):</h3>

      <ul class="rules">
          <li>Player #1 starts round with a Jack.</li>
          <li>
              Player #2 plays 2 queens (playing 2 or 3 10s would not be allowed since to start a {derby} the
              value of your cards has to be better than that of the previous cards played => 10 is not better
              than Jack).
          </li>
          <li>Player #3 passes.</li>
          <li>Player #1 plays 2 Kings.</li>
          <li>Player #2 passes.</li>
          <li>
              Player #3 plays 3 4s (4 is lower than King but since the {derby} has already been started, any larger-card-number play beats a play with fewer cards -> there are 3 4s and only 2 Kings).
          </li>
          <li>Player #1 passes.</li>
          <li>Player #2 passes.</li>
          <li>Player #3 is up but his 3 4s are last played so he wins 8 points (passes do not count as points).</li>
     </ul>

     <h3 class="rules">Example #3, 4 person gameplay (sandwiching and battle):</h3>

     <ul class="rules">
        <li>Player #1 starts round with a 4.</li>
        <li>
            Player #3 jumps in out of turn to play 3 4s sandwiching player #1 (3 4s > 1 4, player #3 could have
            sandwiched with 2 4s as well).
        </li>
        <li>
            If player #1 plays a 4 he is un-sandwiched and sandwiches player #3 back, but if player #2 plays a
            card of Different Value before player #1 un-sandwiches himself, player #1 is out (in the app you wait
            to see if a player can un-sandwich himself before moving on to next player). If player #2 plays a card
            of Same Value, the sandwiching process continues and player #1 still has a chance/time to un-sandwich
            himself. In this case playing a card of Different Value moves on from the sandwiching process.
        </li>
        <li>
            Anyway, player #1 un-sandwiches himself and sandwiches player #3 by playing a 4. Player #3 is now out
            unless he can un-sandwich himself.
        </li>
        <li>
            Player #4 comes in out of turn and plays 2 4s (this game is being played with more than 1 deck) and
            sandwiches player #1, player #3 is still sandwiched. This is possible because the last play is player
            #1's single 4, and player #4's 2 4s are of same value and larger quantity so they sandwich player #1.
        </li>
        <li>
            At this point player #3 can still un-sandwich himself and sandwich player #1 and player #4 if he plays a
            single 4 because his previous 4 play and his next 4 play will wrap around player #4's 2 4s, but player #3
            does not have any other 4s so he is out. Player #1 cannot un-sandwich himself either, so he is out too by
            not having the cards to un/re-sandwich.
        </li>
        <li>
            Player #2 is up and plays 2 4s (he actually plays 1 4 and uses a joker to become the other 4), this
            initiates a {Battle} against player #4. If player #2 had played 3 4s, player 4 would have been sandwiched,
            and if player #2 had played 1 4 it would not be allowed. Note: (in real life/not app) after player #4
            sandwiches players #1 and #3 only player #2 is left in so it is technically his turn even though players #1
            and #3 have a chance to still un-sandwich themselves. So, if player 2 had played any different valued cards
            like 2 5s or three 8s, since player #4s 2 4s also turn the game into a {Derby}, that different valued play
            ends any chance for players #1 and #3 to un-sandwich themselves. If, however, player #1 or #3 did have an
            extra 4 or joker they could still un-sandwich themselves and sandwich the {Battling} players #2 and #4 since
            player #2 played 4s still (you can sandwich people {Battling}: in the app if a {Battling} player plays a card
             down but then gets sandwiched, that card is lost and counts towards the point total at the end but in real
             life you can take that card back into your hand).
        </li>
        <li>
            Anyway, Player #2 had played 2 4s to {Battle} and now plays a wild 9 face down as his {Battle} card.
        </li>
        <li>Player #3 plays a king face down as his {Battle} card.</li>
        <li>
            Both flip and player #3 wins but starting next turn lower cards are better since player #2 played a wild
            9 and switched the direction from higher is better to lower is better.
        </li>
     </ul>

     <p class="rules">This is what the play stack looks like for that round:</p>
     <ul class="rules">
        <li>#1: [4]</li>
        <li>#3: [4, 4, 4]</li>
        <li>#1: [4]</li>
        <li>#4: [4, 4]</li>
        <li>#2: [4, Joker]</li>
        <li>#2: [wild 9]</li>
        <li>#3: [King]</li>
        <li>Battle is now over but: lower cards are now better from now on because of #2's wild 9</li>
        <li>#3 wins round and 11 points because he/she won the battle: a wild 9 can never win a battle</li>
     </ul>
